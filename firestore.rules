/**
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a security model with a clear separation between public and private data.
 * Publicly browsable content, like courses, allows for open read access but restricts write
 * operations to the content creators (instructors). Private user-specific data, such as student
 * profiles and their course enrollments, is strictly confined to the authenticated owner of that data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized into three top-level collections:
 * - /courses: A public collection of all available courses.
 * - /instructors: A restricted collection for instructor profiles.
 * - /users: Contains individual user profiles, with each user's data isolated under their
 *   unique user ID (`/users/{userId}`).
 * Nested within each user's document is an `/enrollments` subcollection, which is private to that user.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Isolation: A user can only access data under their own `/users/{userId}` path. Listing or
 *   accessing other users' profiles or enrollments is strictly forbidden for standard users.
 * - Admin Access: The admin panel is granted read-only access to the full user list by authenticating
 *   with a special anonymous session. This prevents regular users from listing other user data.
 * - Public Content Model: The `/courses` collection is readable by anyone, including unauthenticated
 *   users, to allow for creating, updating, or deleting a course is restricted
 *   to the instructor who owns it, identified by the `instructorId` field on the course document.
 * - Restricted Collections: The `/instructors` collection is currently locked down entirely. An
 *   admin-level role or specific business logic (e.g., via Cloud Functions) is required to manage this data.
 * - Denormalization for Authorization: To ensure fast and secure rule evaluation, authorization
 *   data is stored directly on the documents being secured. For example, the `instructorId` on a
 *   course document avoids the need for slow and costly lookups to other collections.
